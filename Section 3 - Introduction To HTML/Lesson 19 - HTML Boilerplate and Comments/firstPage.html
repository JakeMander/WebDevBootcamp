<!--  Doctype is an artifact of the old days of HTML where all HTML documents required a DOCTYPE to identify the page as HTML and
 a link to the set of HTML rules the page was adhering to. Nowadays, a HTML page just requires a Doctype to function as expected
 and to indicate the page is implementing HTML. The code below is the shortest valid DOCTYPE that can be implemented in order
 to ensure the page runs as expected.  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--  The HTML root element. The base of all HTML documents. All other elements are descendents of the root element.  -->
<html>

<!--  Metadata for the HTML doc goes here. This contains the "data about the data" such as the title of the page, the author, and the character
	set being used. Links to scripts (JavaScript) and style sheets (CSS) are also provided here.  -->
<head>
	<title>Lesson 19. HTML Boilerplate And Comments</title>
</head>

<!--  The body is where the HTML used to represent physical content to be displayed on the page goes.  -->
<body>
	<h1>This is my first tag</h1>
</body>
</html>

<!-- A nifty trick for sublime is to highlight the line of text you want to comment and hit CTRL+/ to comment it out automatically.  -->
