            There once was a man named O'Dell<br>
            Who loved to write HTML<br>
            But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br>
            and his markup didn't read very well.

            Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.
